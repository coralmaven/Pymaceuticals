# Pymaceuticals
Pymaceuticals Inc., a fictitious  pharmaceutical company, specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

Analyze the data from their most recent animal study to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time.
